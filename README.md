## Description

This project is the creation of the back end for an e-commerce site. This application used Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application displays creation of database using mySQL with models and associations. Then demonstrates the API Routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations displayed in my walk through videos.

## Installation

The user should clone the repository from GitHub. This application requires Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize. To connect to the database run `mysql -u root -p` and enter password from .env file. Then source the schema.sql. To seed the file run `npm run seed`. Finally to connect to the server run `npm start`.

## Usage

This application will allow users to view, add, edit, and delete categories, products, and tags.
